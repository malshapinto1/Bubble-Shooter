Modern Bubble Shooter Game Report:

This report details the development of a sophisticated browser-based Bubble Shooter game featuring modern visual effects, complex game mechanics, and optimized performance. The game implements advanced computer graphics concepts, physics simulations, and algorithm optimization techniques while maintaining a clean, modular architecture.

1. Technical Architecture
1.1 System Overview

•	Frontend Stack: HTML5 Canvas + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
•	Architecture Pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC) variant
•	Rendering Pipeline: Dual-layer rendering system (Game Canvas + UI Overlay)
•	Physics Engine: Custom implementation for collision detection and bubble dynamics

1.2 Performance Metrics

•	Target Frame Rate: 60 FPS (request Animation Frame optimized)
•	Memory Usage: <50MB (object pooling implemented)
•	Collision Checks: O(n) optimized spatial partitioning

1.3 Hexagonal Grid System

•	Offset Coordinate System with Odd-Even Row Alignment
•	Matrix Storage: Sparse Array Implementation
•	Grid Navigation:

1.4 Match-3 Algorithm

•	Flood Fill variant with O(n) complexity
•	Dual-phase detection:
1.	Color-based cluster detection
2.	Structural integrity check for floating bubbles
•	Scoring Formula:
Score = (Base × ClusterSize) + (Floating × 1.5) + (Level × 10)


1.5 Visual Effects System
•	Real-time Glass Morphism Rendering:
•	Dynamic Lighting System using Canvas Gradients
•	Particle Effects for Bubble Burst Animation
